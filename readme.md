In my testing of Wanchain I may or may not found a bug where a contract that breaks block gas limit is still deployed.

Here are the details of how I managed to do this. 

`index.html` contains a simple script that connects to Wanchain node and deployserror a new contract using web3. 

When running I get this error:

![error](https://github.com/MoMannn/wanchain-gas-overflow/raw/master/error.png)

But if you look at the [transaction on the block explorer](http://47.104.61.26/block/trans/0xe4721b3756e04e194aea7a36e767ddd35ef0d8875dd8bc79975c2b73c309a6d3) it shows that the contract creation was successful.
